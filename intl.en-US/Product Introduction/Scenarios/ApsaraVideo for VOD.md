# ApsaraVideo for VOD

If your website or application delivers video files, such as short videos and general-purpose videos, you can use Alibaba Cloud Content Delivery Network \(CDN\) to accelerate your website or application. Alibaba Cloud CDN supports mainstream video formats such as MP4 and FLV.

## Scenarios

On-demand video and audio streaming is used by websites and applications that host videos and audios, such as movie, online education, news websites, and social media.

ApsaraVideo for VOD has become an independent Alibaba Cloud service that supports uploads of video and audio files, automatic transcoding, media resource management, and acceleration of content delivery. ApsaraVideo for VOD is an all-in-one and out-of-the-box solution. You can purchase ApsaraVideo for VOD and Alibaba Cloud CDN as a bundle. This saves up to 30% of the total cost. We recommend that you use Alibaba Cloud CDN together with Object Storage Service \(OSS\) to accelerate the back-to-origin process. This saves up to two-thirds of the back-to-origin bandwidth cost.

## Issues resolved

-   Errors or stalling issues occur when end users request video content.
-   The procedures for developing and configuring features that support uploads, transcoding, storage, content delivery, and playback require complex processes and technology expertise.
-   Your website or application is vulnerable to hijacking or unauthorized downloads of video content. The copyright of the video content requires protection.
-   It takes a long time to review short video files uploaded by users. As a result, video files that contain illicit content may be uploaded.
