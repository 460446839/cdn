# Nodes {#concept_uqm_5h3_tdb .concept}

This topic describes the benefits of Alibaba Cloud Content Delivery Network \(CDN\) nodes and how these nodes are distributed across the globe.

Nodes form a network of cloud servers that are deployed in multiple locations around the world. When content is accessed, it is cached in the node that is closest in proximity to the end user for faster retrieval.

## Geographical distribution {#section_7lc_7ea_cqm .section}

Alibaba Cloud CDN has more than 500 nodes spread out over 70 countries. Within China, Alibaba Cloud has more extensive coverage than any other cloud provider, with over 2,000 nodes strategically distributed to serve end users in highly-populated areas. See the following figures.
