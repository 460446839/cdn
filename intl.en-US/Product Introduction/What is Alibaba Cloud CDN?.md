# What is Alibaba Cloud CDN?

Alibaba Cloud Content Delivery Network \(CDN\) is a distributed network built over the bearer network and contains edge nodes deployed in different regions. Alibaba Cloud CDN offloads network traffic from origin servers to prevent network congestion. You can use Alibaba Cloud CDN to accelerate website content delivery in different regions or scenarios.

Alibaba Cloud CDN retrieves resources from origin servers and caches the resources on CDN nodes deployed across the world. When clients request the resources, the requests do not need to be redirected to the origin servers. Instead, Alibaba Cloud CDN automatically retrieves the resources cached on the CDN nodes closest to the clients and returns the resources to the clients. For more information about how to connect to Alibaba Cloud CDN, see [Quick start](/intl.en-US/Quick Start/Overview.md).

Certain CDN nodes can be accessed over IPv6.
