# Back-to-source host {#concept_xwl_fdd_xdb .concept}

## Introduction {#section_y4g_hdd_xdb .section}

You can customize a Web server domain name that a CDN node accesses in the back-to-source process.

**Origin site**: The origin site determines which IP the request is returned to during back-to-source.

**Back-to-source host**: The back-to-source host determines which site on the IP to access when the request is returned to source.

-   Example 1: The origin site of the domain name is `www.a.com`, the back-to-source host is `www.b.com`. then the request is returned to the actual IP resolved through `www.a.com` corresponding to the host site `www.b.com`.
-   Example 2: origin site is IP origin site `1.1.1.1` Back-to-source host is `www.b.com` then the request is actually returned to `www.b.com` of the host corresponding to `1.1.1.1`.

**Note:** Currently, sni back-to-source is not supported.
