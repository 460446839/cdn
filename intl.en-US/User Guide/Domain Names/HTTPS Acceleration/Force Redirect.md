# Force Redirect {#concept_tyh_4rl_xdb .concept}

## Introduction {#section_sms_prl_xdb .section}

When **HTTPS Secure Acceleration** is enabled for a CDN domain, it supports custom settings to perform force redirects on users' original request methods.

For example, when **force HTTPS** redirect is enabled and a user initiates an HTTP request, the server returns a 302 redirect response and the original HTTP request is forcibly redirected to an HTTPS request, as shown in the following figure.

**Force Redirect** is disabled by default. When you enable the feature, both HTTP and HTTPS requests are enabled simultaneously by default.

Options: **Default**, **Force HTTPS redirect**, and **Force HTTP Redirect**.

-   **Force HTTPS redirect**: User requests are forcibly redirected to HTTPS requests.
-   **Force HTTP redirect**: User requests are forcibly redirected to HTTP requests.
