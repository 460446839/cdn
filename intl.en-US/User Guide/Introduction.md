Alibaba Cloud Content Delivery Network\(CDN\) is a distributed network that overlays on the bearer network and is composed of edge node server clusters distributed across different regions. The CDN network replaces the traditional data transmission modes centered on web servers. The CDN console can help you add a CDN domain, refresh cache, and perform other configuration tasks. It also provides resource monitoring services including real-time data analysis. This document presents basic information about the CDN console.
