# All Station Acceleration {#concept_wds_4sl_xdb .concept}

## Introduction to application scenarios {#section_j32_rsl_xdb .section}

All-Stop acceleration is dynamic acceleration, for dynamic and static content mixing across industries, with more dynamic resource requests \(such as ASP, JSP, PHP\) files in equal format\) the site of Ali cloud CDN is accelerated throughout the station to provide:

-   The dynamic and dynamic separation is accelerated, and the dynamic content uses intelligent routing, transmission protocol optimization, and link reuse technology, static content uses edge caching to improve the loading speed of the entire station resource.
-   Real-Time Detection and smooth spanning technology stable and efficient handling of high-flow loads, providing all-day-to-day network availability.
-   Back-to-Back load balancing, multi-source primary provisioning, connection reuse and ordered back-to-back technology reduces source pressure and Failure risk.
-   All link HTTPS Security acceleration, anti-theft chain, IP flow limit, and so on, to ensure the security of the source station.
-   Customize set up static rules, cache rules, and have panoramic information monitoring and warning capabilities.

**Note:** The station-wide acceleration is the default pure dynamic acceleration, which means that all dynamic and static requests obtain resources through the optimal routed backsource, by configuring to specify a static file type or path, you can visually distinguish between dynamic and static resources, static resources cache on the edge node, dynamic resources use dynamic acceleration, to achieve the fastest acceleration effect.

## Billing rules {#section_o4f_vsl_xdb .section}

The station is accelerated as a value-added service and the billing item is "base cost" + "request cost ". Where "base cost" is based on the "by peak bandwidth" or "by traffic" selected by the CDN service "base fee for the charge. "" The number of requests cost contains the number of dynamic HTTP requests, the number of dynamic HTTPS requests, and the number of static HTTPS requests, respectively according to the unit price on a daily basis. All Station acceleration details reference All Station accelerated introduction.
