    After you change the billing method, the new billing method takes effect based on the following rules:

    -   The new billing method takes effect only after the current billing cycle ends.
        -   If you are billed on a daily basis, for example, pay-by-peak-bandwidth, the new billing method takes effect at 00:00:00 \(UTC+8\) on the next day.
        -   If you are billed based on a monthly basis, for example, pay-by-95th-percentile, the new billing method takes effect at 00:00:00 \(UCT+8\) on the first day of the next month.
        -   If the current billing method is pay-as-you-go, the new billing method takes effect at 00:00:00 \(UTC+8\) on the next day.
    -   Before the new billing method takes effect, you cannot change or cancel it. Proceed with caution.
4.  Select *Alibaba Cloud CDN Terms of Service*and click **Activate Now**.
