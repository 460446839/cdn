# Value-added services {#concept_al5_kkl_l2b .concept}

In addition to the basic services, the HTTPS Acceleration is charged separately as value-added services.

## Requests {#section_jdt_lwl_zdb .section}

-   Billing item: Static HTTPS requests.

    **Note:** If you have opened your CDN service as Dynamic Route for CDN on CDN Console before, dynamic HTTPS requests and dynamic HTTP requests will still generate fees. Currently, the [Alibaba Cloud Dynamic Route for CDN](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/product/64812.htm) has been on service. For more information, see [Pricing](https://help.aliyun.com/noticelist/articleid/20701439.html).

-   Payment method: Pay-As-You-Go.

    **Note:** In addition, you can also purchase[HTTPS request package](reseller.en-US/Pricing/Billing method/Pre-paid billing methods.md#section_azn_y4l_l2b) in advance.

-   Billing rule: Billed on all the billing items' price for value-added services. All these requests are accumulated on a calendar day basis.
-   Billing cycle: Billed by day, and fees are deducted in real time \(the bill for the previous day is issued and fees are deducted after 00:00 each day\).
-   Billing time: The end of the current billing cycle \(on a calendar day basis\). A bill is usually generated within one hour after the current billing cycle ends. For example, the bill for June 17 is generated after 0:00 June 18. The system determines the specific time of billing. After a bill is generated, fees are automatically deducted from your account balance to settle the bill.
