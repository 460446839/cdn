# DescribeDomainFlowData {#reference_fqg_5tl_vdb .reference}

Obtain the network traffic metric data of a CDN domain. The unit is bytes.

-   When StartTime and EndTime are not specified, the system reads data from the past 24 hours by default. Query by specified start time and end time is also supported. The two parameters must be both specified.
-   Batch domain name query is supported. Multiple domain names are separated by commas \(half width\).
-   Data from the past 90 days can be obtained at most.

## Request parameters {#section_ukl_d5l_vdb .section}

|Parameters|Type|Required|Example values|Description|
