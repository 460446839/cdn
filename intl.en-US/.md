# Release notes for Alibaba Cloud CDN

This topic provides the release notes of Alibaba Cloud Content Delivery Network \(CDN\).

|Feature|Description|Released date|Region|Reference|
|-------|-----------|-------------|------|---------|
|Rewrite of external links to resolve IPv6 performance issues|IPv6 deployment faces the following challenges: slow responses, content loading errors, and redirection errors. These are known performance issues of IPv6. You cannot resolve these issues by applying the dual-stack technology or upgrading your network or applications if the sites linked to your website do not support IPv6. Alibaba Cloud CDN provides a solution by rewriting the external links on CDN nodes and accelerating them over IPv6.|2020-05|All regions|[EdgeRoute overview]()|
|EdgeRoutine|EdgeRoutine is a computing environment that allows you to deploy JavaScript code on all CDN nodes at a time.|2020-03|All regions|[EdgeRoutine overview]()|
