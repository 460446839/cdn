# Tag use case {#concept_269600 .concept}

This topic describes how to group and manage domain names with tags by using the example of attaching tags to manage domain names.

Assume the following scenario as a use case for tags. A company has 100 domain names on Alibaba Cloud CDN. These domain names are used by three departments \(E-commerce, Gaming, and Entertainment\) to supply marketing, gaming \(specially for example games A and B\), and post-production services. Each department has an executive, whose names are Bob, John, and Tom, respectively.

## Define tags {#section_1k0_v8j_kln .section}

This company defines the following tags, each of which consists of a key and a value. These are used to make grouping and managing domain names easier.

|Key|Value|
|:--|:----|
|Department|E-commerce, Gaming, and Entertainment|
|Services|Marketing, Gaming \(Games A and B\), and Post-production|
|Executive|Bob, John, and Tom|

The company can attach the preceding keys and values to its corresponding domain names.

## Use tags to query domain names {#section_hiq_3md_plh .section}

-   If the company wants to query the domain names that are managed by Tom, it can select the**Executive: Tom**tag.
-   If the company wants to query the domain names that are managed by John from the Gaming department, it can select the**Department: Gaming**and**Executive: John**tags.
