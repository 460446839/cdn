# Configure the QUIC protocol {#task_1215868 .task}

The QUIC protocol is as secure as TLS/SSL, with reduced connection and transmission latency. If you want to improve resource access efficiency and ensure data transmission security, enable the QUIC protocol. This topic describes how to enable the QUIC protocol.

Make sure that you have enabled the HTTPS protocol and uploaded the SSL certificate. For more information, see [Configure HTTPS certificates](intl.en-US/Domain Management/HTTPS Acceleration/Configure HTTPS certificates.md#).
