# Use the statistical analysis function {#task_261642 .task}

You can use the statistical analysis function to check the offline analysis data of CDN domains in the last day and earlier to learn about the running status of CDN.

The Statistics module consists of five parts: PV/UV, By Region/Provider, Popular Referers, Popular URLs, and Domain Name Ranking. You can export detailed raw data such as network bandwidth, traffic, domain name rankings based on traffic proportion, and visitor and provider distribution.

**Note:** The granularity for collecting raw data varies by time range, which is 300s for daily export, 3600s for weekly export data, and 14,400s for monthly export.
