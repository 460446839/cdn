You can call the Content Delivery Network \(CDN\) API to implement various CDN features.

Before you call the CDN API, make sure that you have read the CDN product introduction, usage agreement, and pricing details.

The new CDN API version is 2018-05-10.

For more information about the former CDN API version, see [API Reference \(former version\)](../../../../intl.en-US/API Reference/API Overview.md).

**Note:** We will stop maintaining the former API version soon. We recommend that you use the new CDN API version.

For more information about the relevant terms, see [Appendix](../../../../intl.en-US/API Reference/Appendix.md).
